## Linear Regression Calculator

Calculates the slope and the intercept of the linear regression of the given input file data. 

To use the program, compile the program using `go build main.go`. After that, run the program using `./main ?` where ? is the name of the input file. The input file should preferably be in a .csv format but .txt format is also fine.

The program will output the slope and the intercept of the linear regression model to the standard output once it is done, where there will be four numbers after the decimal point in the output.
